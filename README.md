## My Personal Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website available at denisquaid.com

It is built using Node.js, HandleBars.js, Sass and Gulp.

### To generate HTML files

```
$ npm run build
```

### To watch for changes

```
$ npm run watch
```

Edit `data/static-data.json` and utilise the data in handlebars files to create HTML files and partials.
