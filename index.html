          <h3 class="mission-statement-title">About Me</h3>
          <div class="mission-statement">
            I'm a Cork based iOS and tvOS developer currently working with <b>Teamwork</b> where I focus on building features for the Projects iOS app<br><br>

            Before joining Teamwork in 2017, I worked at Net-A-Porter for three years as a developer on the Net-A-Porter app, as a result of my time at Net-A-Porter I am used to working on apps with a large user base and have been exposed to a number of industry standard tools including all major iOS frameworks, analytics services including Adobe and Fabric, Version control tools as well as releasing and monitoring through iTunes connect.<br><br>

            As well as the Net-A-Porter iOS app, I also worked within a small team to produce the worlds first shoppable tvOS app, the <b>Mr Porter Apple TV</b> allows user to browse through the full library of videos on Mr Porter's editorial and also allows user's to buy any of the items they see by connecting their phones.<br><br>

            Throughout my time as a developer, I have developed using Objective-C, but since the release of Swift 2, I have migrated my skills in order to make Swift my primary programming language. I also have experience using Node.js as well as front-end languages such as HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript which I have used for hacks, personal projects and websites.

          <div class="further-info">
