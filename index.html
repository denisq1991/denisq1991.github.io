          <h3 class="mission-statement-title">About Me</h3>
          <div class="mission-statement">
            I'm a Cork based iOS and tvOS developer currently working with  <a href="http://www.teamwork.com" class="link"><b>Teamwork</b></a> where I focus on building features for the Projects iOS app<br><br>

            Before joining Teamwork in 2017, I worked at Net-A-Porter for three years as a developer on the Net-A-Porter app, as a result of my time at Net-A-Porter I am used to working on apps with a large user base and have been exposed to a number of industry standard tools including all major iOS frameworks, analytics services including Adobe and Fabric, Version control tools as well as releasing and monitoring through iTunes connect.<br><br>

            As well as the Net-A-Porter iOS app, I also worked within a small team to produce the worlds first shoppable tvOS app, the <b>Mr Porter Apple TV</b> allows user to browse through the full library of videos on Mr Porter's editorial and also allows user's to buy any of the items they see by connecting their phones. The Net-A-Porter app can be downloaded from here <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/net-a-porter-designer-clothes/id318597939" class="link"></a><br><br>

            Throughout my time as a developer, I have developed using Objective-C, but since the release of Swift 2.0, I have migrated my skills in order to make Swift my primary programming language. My primary IDE is XCode and I have a depth of knowledge related to all things Swift related of which I strive to keep up to date with through the official Apple documentation as well as blogs.<br><br>

            I also have experience using Node.js as well as front-end languages such as HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript which I have used for hacks, personal projects and websites.<br><br>

            I am available to offer one on one iOS tutoring online or anywhere in Cork city to students or developers alike, if you would like to enquire about private tutoring me, I can be reached by email at <a href="denis91@gmail.com">denisq91@gmail.com</a>.<br>
