            <h3 class="mission-statement-title">About Me</h3>
            <div class="mission-statement">
                  I'm a London Based iOS and tvOS developer currently working with <b>the YOOX NET-A-PORTER Group</b> where I focus on building features for the Net-A-Porter iOS app as well as the <b>MR PORTER</b> tvOS app.<br><br>

                  Having worked on the Net-A-Porter on a daily basis for the past two years, I am used to working on apps
                  with a large user base and have been exposed to a number of industry standard tools including all major iOS frameworks, analytics services including Adobe and Fabric, Version control tools as well as releasing and monitoring through iTunes connect.<br><br>

                  As well as the Net-A-Porter iOS app, I also worked within a small team to produce the worlds first shoppable tvOS app, the <b>Mr Porter Apple TV</b> allows user to browse through the full library of videos on Mr Porter's editorial and also allows user's to buy any of the items they see by connecting their phones.<br><br>

                  Throughout my time as a developer, I have developed using Objective-C, but since the release of Swift 2, I have migrated my skills in order to make Swift my primary programming language. I'm also proficient in using Node.js as well as front-end languages such as HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript which I have used for hacks, projects and websites.
